## Training pipeline

### 1. Select a training configuration file and get pre-trained snapshot if available.

```bash
$ export CONFIGURATION_FILE=./configs/mobilenetv2_tiny_ssd300_wider_face.py
```

Pre-trained model is available [here](https://download.01.org/opencv/openvino_training_extensions/models/object_detection/wider_face_tiny_ssd_075x_epoch_70.pth).

### 2. Collect dataset

Download the [WIDER Face](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/) and unpack it to the `data` folder.

### 3. Prepare annotation

Convert downloaded and extracted annotation to MSCOCO format with `face` as the only one class.

* Training annotation
   ```bash
   $ python tools/task_specific/face_detection/wider_to_coco.py \
            data/wider_face_split/wider_face_train_bbx_gt.txt \
            data/WIDER_train/images/ \
            data/train.json
   ```

* Validation annotation
   ```bash
   $ python tools/task_specific/face_detection/wider_to_coco.py \
            data/wider_face_split/wider_face_val_bbx_gt.txt \
            data/WIDER_val/images/ \
            data/val.json
   ```

### 4. Training and Fine-tuning
Try both following variants and select the best one:
   * By **training** from scratch or using pre-trained weights - only if you have a lot of data, let's say tens of thousands or even more images. This variant assumes long training process starting from big values of learning rate and eventually decreasing it according to training schedule.
   * By **fine-tuning**. This variant assumes training staring from pre-trained weights with small learning rate that was used in the end of training process of existing snapshot. One should understand that during training model is forgetting about data that was initially trained on (if you don't use it your current training). That's why you should no train you model too long to avoid making model worse than it was before your training has started, especially if you have small dataset.

If you would like to start **training** from pre-trained weights do not forget to modify `load_from` path inside configuration file.

If you would like to start **fine-tuning** from pre-trained weights do not forget to modify `resume_from` path inside configuration file as well as increase `total_epochs`. Otherwise training will be ended immideately.
* To train the detector on a single GPU, run in your terminal:
   ```bash
   $ python ../../external/mmdetection/tools/train.py \
            $CONFIGURATION_FILE
   ```

* To train the detector on multiple GPUs, run in your terminal:
   ```bash
   $ ../../external/mmdetection/tools/dist_train.sh \
            $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
            <GPU_NUM>
   ```


### 5. Validation

* To dump detection of your model as well as compute MS-COCO metrics run:
   ```bash
   $ python ../../external/mmdetection/tools/test.py \
            $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
            <CHECKPOINT> \
            --out result.pkl \
            --eval bbox
   ```

* You can also measure WiderFace quality metrics:
  1. Convert `result.pkl` obtained from previous step to WiderFace-friendly output:
     ```bash
     $ python tools/test_out_to_wider_predictions.py \
              $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
              result.pkl \
              <OUTPUT_FOLDER>
     ```
  2. Run WiderFace validation either with
     * [Official Matlab evaluation code](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/support/eval_script/eval_tools.zip)
     * [Python implementation](https://github.com/wondervictor/WiderFace-Evaluation) (anyway you have to download [Official Matlab evaluation code](http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/support/eval_script/eval_tools.zip) to get annotation in matlab format). Run from cloned repo following command
        ```bash
        $ python evaluation.py -p <OUTPUT_FOLDER> -g <WIDERFACE_MATLAB_ANNOTATION>
        ```

### 6. Export
* Export to ONNX
  * In most cases you can convert PyTorch\* model to the ONNX\* format by running the `export.py` script:
     ```bash
     $ python ../../external/mmdetection/tools/export.py \
              $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
              <CHECKPOINT> \
              model.onnx
     ```

  * If your model is SSD-like detector you can convert PyTorch\* model to the ONNX\* format by running the `export_ssd.py` script. Note: model exported in such way will produce a bit different results (non-significant in most cases) but it also might be faster that model exported by `export.py`. The `export.py` can export SSD models as well.
     ```bash
     $ python ../../external/mmdetection/tools/export_ssd.py \
              $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
              <CHECKPOINT> \
              model.onnx
     ```
  2. Convert ONNX model to the OpenVINOâ„¢ format with the Model Optimizer with the command below:
     ```bash
     python ../../external/mmdetection/tools/convert_to_ir.py \
            $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
            model.onnx \
            <EXPORT_FOLDER>
     ```
    This produces model `model.xml` and weights `model.bin` in single-precision floating-point format
    (FP32). The obtained model expects **normalized image** in planar BGR format.

### 7. Validataion of IR

Instead running of `test.py` you need to run `test_exported.py` and then repeat steps listed in [Validation paragraph](#5-validation).

If you exported model using `export_ssd.py` you need to add `--with_detection_output` option, otherwise you don't need to use such flag. If you converted the exported model using `convert_to_ir.py` then the model expects **normalized image** in planar BGR format, so you need to disable data pre-processing by adding `--do_not_normalize`.
   ```bash
   python ../../external/mmdetection/tools/test_exported.py  \
          $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
          <EXPORT_FOLDER>/model.xml \
          --with_detection_output \
          --do_not_normalize \
          --out results.pkl \
          --eval bbox
   ```

### 8. Demo

To see how the converted model works using OpenVINO you need to run `test_exported.py` with `--show` option.
   ```bash
   python ../../external/mmdetection/tools/test_exported.py  \
          $CONFIGURATION_FILE \
          <EXPORT_FOLDER>/model.xml \
          --with_detection_output \
          --do_not_normalize \
          --show
   ```
